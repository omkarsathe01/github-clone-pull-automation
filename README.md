## Introduction

This project automates the clone and pull operations for a GitHub user's repositories.
If you want to clone/pull all the GitHub repositories including private then you are at the right place!
This script clones all the repositories which are new and pulls and updates the repositories which are alredy present.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have GitHub Account and have the Personal access token with read permissions, click [here](https://github.com/omkarsathe01/github-clone-pull-automation/blob/main/generate-github-personal-access-token.md) for steps to generate one.

### Run the Script

To automate the process, you can run the following command in your terminal. This command retrieves the script directly from the GitHub repository and executes it.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omkarsathe01/github-clone-pull-automation/main/script.sh | bash
```

Note: Running scripts directly from the internet can pose security risks. Ensure that you trust the source before executing the command.

Don't worry you can absolutely trust me, I'm not gonna steal your secrets ðŸ˜Š

### Enter the Required Details

Enter your GitHub username, in my case it's `omkarsathe01`.

Copy and paste your GitHub Personal access token which will be something like `github_pat_rIm43Hx2nD11AQLLPOY0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` it will be not be visible in the command line and hit enter button.
